 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 &ldquo;Copyright Holder&rdquo; means the individual(s) or organization(s)
 named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 &ldquo;Contributor&rdquo; means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&rsquo;s
 procedures.
 .
 &ldquo;You&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; means any person who would like to copy,
 distribute, or modify the Package.
 .
 &ldquo;Package&rdquo; means the collection of files distributed by the
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
 those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
 Version, or a Modified Version.
 .
 &ldquo;Distribute&rdquo; means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 &ldquo;Distributor Fee&rdquo; means any fee that you charge for Distributing
 this Package or providing support for this Package to another
 party. It does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 &ldquo;Standard Version&rdquo; refers to the Package if it has not been
 modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
 by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; means the Package, if it has been changed, and
 such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
 Holder.
 .
 &ldquo;Original License&rdquo; means this Artistic License as Distributed with
 the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
 it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 &ldquo;Source&rdquo; form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 &ldquo;Compiled&rdquo; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
 or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
 translation of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
 of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
 Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
 Version.
 .
 (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
 prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
 addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
 from the name of the Standard Version.
 .
 (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
 make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
 under
 .
 (i) the Original License or
 .
 (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
 modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
 licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
 received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
 Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
 Fees are allowed.
 .
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
 or Modified Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
 the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
 the Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions

 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.
 .
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
